 Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance. You can select an AMI provided by AWS, our user community, or the AWS Marketplace; or you can select one of your own AMIs.

Once Amazon RDS finishes provisioning your DB instance, you can use a SQL client application or utility to connect to the instance.
