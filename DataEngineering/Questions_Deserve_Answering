Initial Exploration
- What is the Question that I am trying to answer?
- What kind of Data do I have?
  - Where do the data features that are seemingly the same type coming from?
  - are those data actually compatible?
  - how to massage the data into a consolidated format?
    - ex ) date format / some fields have different naming conventions (which sometimes makes things near impossible to merge)
    - sometimes this gets super tricky to deal with especially when data becomes very large. a single query can take very long
    - comparing two tables
    - 
- Creating the SQL Script
  - pure SQL
    - start from the base table
    - resolve the entity
      - decide the granularity of the table and do the correct group by
      - be aware of the consequences of the group by
        - the detailed feature might not be a single value by multiple reasons
          - why entailed fatures are not distinct by entity group by?
            - data collection for the entailed features might have failed
              ex ) device_os, geo lat, geo lon, city, device graphic card, cumumlative count.. these can be missing
              - considering the data collection strategy of the original features, we need to decide how to consolidate the features.
              - for example, if we know that the device_os should not change because device_id represents hashed information about the device_os, we can be rest assured that selecting any value of device_os when grouping by device_id is an acceptable entailed feature collapsing strategy
              - device_id, MAX(device_os_name) group by device_id
            - certain user might have connected from two different countries within a single partition duration of time
              -
