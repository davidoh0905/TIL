<h2>Abductive Reasoning</h2>
Abductive reasoning (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all uses of the terms abduction and inference to the best explanation are exactly equivalent.
(ref : [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) )

Any argument that is not deductively valid, or deductively invalid, is called an <b>ampliative argument</b>. The term refers to the fact that the conclusion of such argument goes beyond, or amplifies upon, the premises.
